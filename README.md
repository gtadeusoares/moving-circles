# Moving Circles
This is a mini game where you can try to "cross the road". If you get hit by one of the moving circles, you start again from the initial position. 
# Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move.
# Future Improvements
Separate the JavaScript into a new file. 

Create one function to update all circles simultaneously.
